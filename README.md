<h3 align = "center"> Problem Statement </h3>

<h4 align = "left">Postural dysfunction or “Poor” posture is defined as when our spine is positioned in unnatural positions, in which the curves are emphasised and this results in the joints, muscles and vertebrae being in stressful positions. This prolonged poor positioning results in a build up of pressure on these tissues.</h4>


<h3 align = "center"> Why it is a problem? </h3>

<h4 align = "left">This is a common issue nowadays, most of the work is being done in front of computer screens, sitting for long hours with a bad posture may lead to serious health issues. Apart from that we indulge ourselves to much that we don't even realize our posture.</h4>
